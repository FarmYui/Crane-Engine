# CraneEngine
Crane Engine is created by following the "Game Engine" tutorial series by the Cherno

![Crane](/Resources/Branding/CraneEngineLogo.png?raw=true "Crane")

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Crane is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/FarmYui/CraneEngine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

Unfortunately the submodules are not maintained anymore so make sure to follow the vid i made to setup correctly 
the dependencies (to avoid headaches)

remember to include in prj stb_image.cpp

In the future obv i will try to remove the submodules and update them but i'm not going to do that any time soon
