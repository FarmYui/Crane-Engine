The scene was entirely made with tools inside the editor

## Getting Started
💻 Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Crane only supports Windows.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/FarmYui/CraneEngine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

Unfortunately the submodules are not maintained anymore so make sure to follow the vid i made to setup correctly 
the dependencies (to avoid headaches)

update: turn on staticruntime in premakefile of yaml-cpp or it will give linking errors ;

In the future obv i will try to remove the submodules and update them but i'm not going to do that any time soon
