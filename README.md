# CraneEngine
üèóÔ∏è Crane Engine is created by following the "Game Engine" tutorial series by the Cherno
Crane Engine was originally born as 2D but has native support for 3D too, 
in fact the Editor camera supports pitch & yaw rotations, so you can move around the scene with ease

## Getting Started
üíª Visual Studio 2022 is recommended, Crane only supports Windows.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/FarmYui/CraneEngine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

Unfortunately the submodules are not maintained anymore so make sure to follow the vid i made to setup correctly 
the dependencies (to avoid headaches)

update: turn on staticruntime in premakefile of yaml-cpp or it will give linking errors ;

In the future obv i will try to remove the submodules and update them but i'm not going to do that any time soon
